# Dynamic-CRANE-control-LQR-and-LQG-optimization.

The project focuses on managing the motion of a crane traveling along a one-dimensional track, where the crane acts as a frictionless cart with a mass denoted as M. The system is controlled by an external force F, which acts as the input to manipulate the system.
